* Notes

Some of my notes on configurations. My most recent linux installs from 3/2021 are not included.

*** IDEA apparently this is simply what the ~~/org~ project was supposed to be ... something i would never simply know since I've never even so much as seen someone use Emacs while living in Roanoke, VA

* Personal ~org-mode~ philosophy:

** OKAY So I'm still a noob...

... but notes/etc in this section should serve to cultivate good habits ... and to trim away habits that would seem to lead to some certain doom -- i.e. ~death by 1,000 errant TODO's~

** TODO every TODO should be written to be thrown away instantly
** TODO hmmmmm

* [[./etc.org]]

This should be a /mostly literate/ file declarative configuration of:

** Subtrees of file-system paths for projects and languages

** Repo URL's which should be cloned into a tree of subdirectories
*** like the github repos of interest i've listed in various ~README.md~ files

** The idea here is that I'm documenting what i'm doing so that it can be extended with minimal effort, regenerated if needed and easily found without looking
