* Notes

** TODO create a ~literate~ section that


* Personal ~org-mode~ philosophy:

** OKAY So I'm still a noob...

... but notes/etc in this section should serve to cultivate good habits ... and to trim away habits that would seem to lead to some certain doom -- i.e. ~death by 1,000 errant TODO's~

** TODO every TODO should be written to be thrown away instantly
** TODO hmmmmm

* [[./etc.org]]

This should be a /mostly literate/ file declarative configuration of:

** Subtrees of file-system paths for projects and languages
** Repo URL's which should be cloned into a tree of subdirectories
*** like the github repos of interest i've listed in various ~README.md~ files

** The idea here is that I'm documenting what i'm doing so that it can be extended with minimal effort, regenerated if needed and easily found without looking

* Language/Topic Locations

These should include:

** A file system path, relative to some global ~$DEV_HOME~ path
** Supporting scripts for automating project checkout/sync
*** this could either be similar to git-modules or git modules itself ... though that's entirely too much work for this.
**** I just want lists of dumb, cloned repos that can be easily pulled if needed (and if their tree isn't in a dirty state)
**** (github: you should probably make a "playlists" feature for git repos, where groups of repos can be checked out together, but which are meant to be used for reference only)
***** ... unless there is some better way of doing that already
*** some would be global (i.e. ~sync-cloned-repos~)
*** some would be per-language or per-topic
** These supporting scripts could be written with ~org-babel~ and with the ~tangle~ exports being written to hardlinked locations in both ~./_notes/~ and ~$LANG_HOME~
