* Guix

** Guix System

*** Potential Problems with an Early Switch

+ Managing multiple systems
  - =/home/dc= may not seemlessly port between both systems
    + potential state problems here
  - both Gnome/KDE in the same HOME/XDG config directories?
+ Friction
  - Being without dotfiles/dev/tools
+ Known timesinks
  - Scheme/Guile & tooling thereof
  - cataloguing time sinks
+ Fuzzy timesinks
  - XMonad?
  - Kernel kconfig
+ Unexpected config problems
+ Incompatiility
+ Learning Curve for new tools
  - init system (init.d, runit, init...x)
  - Gnome (or gnome alternatives)
  - configuring KDE/Plasma?

** Transition Process

*** Arch with pacman + guix
+ identify packages/groups that are easy to port with
+ start building base guix package groups
  - build specific groups
+ decide how to handle DKMS hooks
  - this is a real fucked up gotcha
  - if it hooks your DKMS, guix is probably hard
  - i.e. nvidia, kernel modules, zen kernel
  - there are a lot of wrong answers to this and probably some simple ones.

*** Quickly try Guix System
