#### 2. Use the default display density.

- recommended to just go with it for now

#### 3. Create new labels.

- Divide labels into sub-labels.
- And Use multiple labels per email (if necessary).

#### 6. Add more tabs (Categories) and organize them.

- click the Gear icon and click “Configure inbox.”

#### 7. Utilize markers.

- TODO: possible to do this within **Thunderbird**?
- recommended use is to mark emails you haven’t acted on.
  - shows emails are there purely for informational purposes
  - and ones requiring action 
    - (such as a reply, or the completion of a task)
- The only potential hiccup here is when you unmark an email thread, then
  receive a new email in that thread that gives you a new action item.

#### 8. Enable automatic marking.

#### 9. Take advantage of read, unread, and snoozed messages.

#### 10. Add more stars.

- TODO: add more stars
- TODO: find out how this carries over to **Thunderbird**?
- you might go with Gmail’s recommended 4-star system, 

#### 11. Come up with a star system.

- perhaps use stars as an indication of urgency or importance.
- or use these symbols as a way to indicate type of action needed
  - blue i -- waiting for more information, 
  - purple ? -- question needing an answer from you.
  - yellow ! -- light task
  - red ! -- heavy task


#### 12. Toggle conversation view.

 [pros/cons](https://emailanalytics.com/outlook-vs-gmail-which-is-better/) of
 gmails conversation view vs outlook-style

#### 13. Enable hover actions.

- you can click a single button, rather than navigating to a submenu and
  selecting the sorting options from there.
- example actions: 
  - archiving/deleting, 
  - marking as read/unread
  - snoozing
- enable this feature by heading to the General tab in Settings, then clicking
  "Enable hover actions."
  - TODO: how does this correspond to Thunderbolt 
    - e.g. QuickFolder actions/menu?

#### 14. Turn on the Preview Pane.

- TODO: enable in GMail Labs

#### 15. Establish automatic filters.

- generally, be as specific as possible (unless it's easy to be comprehensive)

#### 16. Consider implementing Multiple Inboxes.

- TODO: how does this translate to **Thunderbird**?
- create saved views of email filters (i guess without applying the rules)
  - view only starred emails with target phrase in subject
  - or view only marked emails from a specific sender.

#### 17. Work toward inbox zero 5 emails at a time.

Two General Tips:

- One, **process any emails in your inbox first**** before pursuing organization
  - process them first to index them later

- Second, just five emails at a time.
  - work toward **Inbox Zero** referring to an inbox full of emails that are
    appropriately marked and/or categorized, according to your system
