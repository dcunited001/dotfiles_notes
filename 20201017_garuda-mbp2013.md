#### DEV CONFIG & WORKFLOW `~/.doom.d/README.md`

## Webcam (mbp2013)

- `sudo pamac install bcwc-pcie-git`

## NVidia

NVidia must be installed via `nvidia-390xx-dkms` so the drivers can be
recompiled when kernel is rebuilt.

- [ArchWiki: nvidia](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Installation)
- [ArchWiki: DKMS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support)

#### Vulkan (for WebGPU)

[nvidia-vulkan](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvidia-vulkan) requires
Kernel >= 5.7, possibly some kernel patch and (if so) some clever DKMS
autobuild, which would be super-fun with Linux-Zen, I'm sure

- [nvidia-full-vulkan-all](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvidia-full-vulkan-all):
  Manual kernel build (no dkms)

## NVENC & Gstreamer

Required for OBS studio to use NVENC to stream, as is CUDA which makes building
`gst-plugins-bad/libs` and/or `gstreamer-nvidia/libs` difficult. If apple wasn't
an asshole and opened up the integrated graphics chip to other OS's when
discrete GPU is available, then unicorns would prance in a shimmering
lisafrankesque skyworld farting rainbows and showering us with IPO's .... but
no. we can't have nice things.

### Dependencies

#### To get NVidia: 

`sudo pacman -Syu nvidia-390xx-utils nvidia-390xx-settings nvidia-390xx-dkms`

#### To get CUDA: 

`sudo pamac -Syu cuda-11.0` ... or is it 11.1, 11.2 or 10.0. The
`gstreamer-nvidia` docs and AUR packages below have conflicting information. As
of 6/2020, the AUR builds were checking for `CUDA 10.1` at the latest.

CUDA is provided as 11.2 (via `community`), but GST plugins isn't yet updated.

#### For now, CUDA version 10.1 is needed

`sudo pamac -Syu cuda-10.0 gstreamer-nvidia` to install 

#### Dragons

Also compounding the difficulty & time required: several of these dependencies
will try to slip in `nvidia-4..xx` if you're not paying attention, which means
(if you're lucky and don't reboot), then you're looking at the same pacman logs
trying to figure out what the fuck you have to do. if you reboot ... hope you
know the handy Grub nosplash/~quiet~ trick that lets you use `Ctrl-Alt-F2` to
start up a seperate linux CMD line session......... otherwise, grab your fucking
USB it's time to follow the white rabbit down a chroot (literally 8 hours in on
this one... and I spent another 4-8 trying to figure out why graphics weren't
working without realizing linux-zen-5.11.whatever is incompatible with anything
less than `nvidia-390.141`..............

#### Modifying the PKGBUILD for `gstreamer-nvidia`

to complete the `sudo pamac install ffmpeg-full` ... nevermind, fuck that.

- remove `sudo pacman -Rns olivia mpv` to remove some basic media players.
- remove `sudo pacman -Rns retroarch retroarch-assets-glui retroarch-assets-ozone retroarch-assets-xmb retroarch-autoconfig-udev-git` to remove some old-school emulation
- install `sudo pacman -Syu svt-hevc svt-av1 svt-vp9` to add mysterious codecs from the futuress...
- install `sudo pacman -Syu gstreamer-docs gstreamermm-docs zxing-cpp hotdoc` for other undeclared `gstreamer-nvidia` dependencies
- install `sudo pacman -Syu xorg-server-xvfb` and start a new shell

upping to the `gstreamer-nvidia` version `1.18.2` commit SHA (maybe?) requires building `gst-plugins-bad-git` while modifying the set of plugins to build. 

after building add the following to the `PKGBUILD` for `gstreamer-nvidia`:

```
-D magicleap=disabled \ 
-D wasapi2=disabled \
-D isac=disabled \
-D doc=disabled
```

before build, add `libldac` and `libopenaptx` to the dependencies in `.SRCINFO`.
now build with `makepkg -si`. if you get failure in the `check()` step, you may be missing `xorg-server-xvfb` or you might be alright skipping that step. 

.............still running into documentation problems

## Downloading *.run install scripts from NVidia:

fails bc custom dkms builds (with patches) for linux zen kernel.

## Making a package for nvidia-418xx (with patches)

- requires copying existing packages for nvidia-390xx, examining PKGBUILD and
  patches, crossing fingers, then hoping my cargo culting doesn't waste 80_MORE_HOURS_OF_MY_FUCKING_TIME.


## OBS Studio & VAAPI via `nouveau`, `mesa` and `ffmpeg-nocuda`

#### uninstall `nvidia`

#### install `nouveau` & `mesa`

#### remove nouveau from `mhwd` blacklist and nvidia from `/etc/xorg.conf`

#### remove ffmpeg, remove orphaned packages, reinstall all packages

#### install `ffmpeg-nocuda`

#### reinstall obs-studio-wayland

nope .... well not yet. fail to write webcam output to file.

```
ffmpeg -loglevel debug -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 -f v4l2 -video_size 1920x1080 -i /dev/video1 -vf 'format=nv12,hwupload' -c:v h264_vaapi output.mp4
```

- the outputs returned by `vainfo` and `vdpauinfo` [don't look promising](https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/26464/amd-support-for-ffmpeg-cant-get-my-dedicated-gpu-to-work)
