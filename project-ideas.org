*** Colorimetry

**** Get ideas from Jan Koenderink's [[https://www.amazon.com/Color-Sciences-MIT-Press-Koenderink/dp/0262014289][Color for the Sciences]]

**** Abuse WebAudio for color space computations

see [[https://media-codings.com/articles/what-else-can-we-do-with-the-web-audio-api][this article]] for a simple way to chain many computations together. it
requires overhead in marshalling data into/out of a WebAudio thread (which runs
separatedly)

also, there are examples of using [[https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioWorklet-Examples][WebAudio AudioWorklet]] to accomplish the same
thing, but functions are restricted within the computations (they must translate
to DSP computations AFAIK)

** Emacs

*** pacman/AUR interface

this would be nice
