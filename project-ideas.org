* Project Ideas

** Graphics

*** Colorimetry

**** Get ideas from Jan Koenderink's [[https://www.amazon.com/Color-Sciences-MIT-Press-Koenderink/dp/0262014289][Color for the Sciences]]

**** Abuse WebAudio for color space computations

see [[https://media-codings.com/articles/what-else-can-we-do-with-the-web-audio-api][this article]] for a simple way to chain many computations together. it
requires overhead in marshalling data into/out of a WebAudio thread (which runs
separatedly)

also, there are examples of using [[https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioWorklet-Examples][WebAudio AudioWorklet]] to accomplish the same
thing, but functions are restricted within the computations (they must translate
to DSP computations AFAIK)

** Emacs

*** pacman/AUR/yay interface

this would be nice

*** package to ingest/deconstruct metadata for various commands to brainstorm elisp dev ui/ux

- ... "di/dx"
- e.g. reflect on zsh completion to figure out what's relevant to implement with emacs-lisp (maybe a better way to do this)
- reflect on other doc sources (man, info) to elucidate a binding surface
