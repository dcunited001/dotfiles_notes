* Synth Bio

Some notes for potential exploration of synthetic bio. These notes should be
more focused on semi-synthetic biology. Documenting this digitally makes more
sense than doing so by hand. Org-mode has [[https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/category/orgmode/5/][functions to generate chemical structures from SMILE]]

** Evolution and Natural Chemicals (i.e. essential oils, neurotransmitters, etc)

First on an informal typological analysis of natural chemicals, processes and
receptors, e.g.

+ what common features do these chemicals/processes share?
+ what is responsible for the diversity in natural chemicals like essential oils
  and/or neurotransmitters?
+ what genes or processes are responsible for shaping the development &
  recombination of terpinoids and other natural chemicals?
+ how do environmental factors further shape/inform these processes and why does it create a selective advantage for the plants/animals?
+ how do the traditional/medical applications relate to their structures?
+ how do the values/effects of these natural chemicals in plants relate to their medicinal value?

Specifically, to the last question: are there chemicals which act as astringents
in plants which are also medically useful as chemicals that produce astringent
effects in humans? This could speak volumes on how practioners in traditional
medicine formed ideas about _why_ some plants seemed promising for treating
various symptoms/conditions:

+ e.g. the function of ginseng's adaptogenic compounds in modulating nitric
  oxide: does nitric oxide have similar functions in plants as in humans, where
  it increases fluid flow? ...

** Emergence of Chemical Structure in Evolution is not Arbitrary

What is fascinating about neurotransmitters, like Serotonin and Dopamine
specifically, is that their value in natural organisms can be arrived at purely
from first principles. Chiefly, they are among some of the fewest chemical structures which are guaranteed to be:

+ constructed from a mass-minimal number of parts (resulting from a minimal number of chemical reactions)
+ constructed from a relatively minimal number of /simple/ parts that should occur naturally in relatively high-numbers
+ produced only as products of decarboxylation or mechanisms that cannot occur in nature frequently /without enzymes/

That's it. That's why every organic lifeform would find serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitters to be valueable: their relative occurance as modified amino acids can be controlled by amplifying/attenuating the presence/absence of enzymes. This allows organism to use their presence/absence/quantity as a kind of "variable" in genetic programs.

There are other "simpicial" chemical structures as well, but there should also
be terpenoids whose structure satisfies similar "emergence" conditions. Studying
essential oils in detail would be illuminating.


*** Vitamin A

Vitamin A may be a "solution" to a similar problem. The structures of vitamins cannot simply be arbitrary, since any selective advantage or dual roles
should be strongly selected for. Vitamin A is used in cellular processes (enzymes/etc), but also offers a wide variety of forms (e.g. molecular variants and
crystal strucutures affecting the color). Astaxanthin has a far higher ORAC value than vitamin A or C. So, this may be a dual purpose to Vitamin A that facilitated its selection.

Furthermore, Vitamin A may have a chemical structure that represents a kind of "free energy landscape vortex" . It would seem to exhibit the property where it may survive encounters 
with random oxidation reactions -- but far more profound: of the various chemical structures that can result following such oxidation reactions, Vitamin A may display a kind of self-healing
property, where either its chemical structure or its crystal lattice will cause the mutated Vitamin A molecules to gradually return to their original form after several oxidation reactions.

This would cause it to be over-represented in the species of chemicals available to early life (esp. early plant life), in turn causing it to be a chemical species that is consistently available
frequently enough to be relied on for chemical/enzymatic processes or the regulation of those proesses.

** Probabilistic Programs, Beta-Glycans and Mushrooms

*** TODO port over content from my chemistry notebook on beta-glycans
+ specifically on how beta-glycans mirror objects from statitics (specifically
  in bayesian methods)

*** TODO look into the relationship between [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinocandin][Echinocandins]] and the human body's own beta-glucans

+ Echinocandins modify beta-glucan structures on the invasive or ingested fungus
  to enable the host's immune system to recognize them more quickly

#+begin_quote
In vitro and mouse models show echinocandins may also enhance host immune
responses by exposing highly antigenic beta-glucan epitopes that can accelerate
host cellular recognition and inflammatory responses.

* Galaxy Tools

Have a look at [[https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools][bgruening/galaxytools]] for pointers to tons of sciency tools. Most of the [[https://galaxyproject.org/][Galaxy Tools]] are hosted in Mercurial repositories in the [[https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/][galaxy tool shed]].

+ That I can grok most of the tool descriptions in a single pass is definitive proof of how much of a failure I am. Not sure why I can speedread academic literature, but that would probably prove useful, were society to not so singlemindedly try to shut me out of every single goddamn thing.

* Open Babel

[[https://openbabel.org/wiki/XML][Open Babel]] is a tool for working with molecules and stuff. More details needed.

** Body Odor (Bromhidrosis)

hmmm my body is processing thiols/etc strangely (I don't remember garlic doing
this before) [[https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2013/may/hyperhidrosis-and-bromhidrosis/#7][Guide to asessment and management]]

*** Cotton vs Polyester
**** [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25128346/][10.1128/AEM.01422-14]]: Microbial odor profile of polyester and cotton clothes after a fitness session
+ Seven aspects of odor were measured subjectively
  - hedonic ::
  - intensity ::
  - ::


[[file:img/synthbio/body-odor-bacteria-strains.jpg][bacterial species]]

+ My take: bacterial population distributions grouped by species exhibit
  profiles (clusters) of population/species. Some species will tend to dominate,
  pushing others to exclusion; lacking some species or environmental conditions
  will tend to disrupt the equilibrium of a population profile.
  - Some species or subspecies will produce specific chemicals, which together produce an odor profile (see above: /five qualitative odor characteristics/)
  - Altering environmental conditions will upregulate some bacterial processes or chemical processes:
    - substrate (fabric),
    - respiration
    - exercise time
    - cohabitating species
    - diet (garlic, or other thiol-containing foods)
    - electrolytes or sweat composition
  - The fabric/substrate & overall environmental conditions will greatly affect the mobility of some organic chemical compounds
    - e.g. phys. properties like boiling point or solvent/solute processes like
      sublimation
    - because of these functional couplings...
      - fabric :: substrate & chemical-specific sublimation
      - fabric :: respiration & upregulation of bacterial processes yielding chemicals with functional groups
    - ... then the fabric alters dynamics of the odor's chemical profile, dispersion into the air and olfactory perception
      - for gustatory senses (taste), functional groups activate
      - this is similar for olfactory senses:
        - thiols, in particular, produce the smells of asparagus & garlic in
          urine, which also share similar smells to other metabolized byproducts
          containing thiol functional groups (when those by products are
          somewhat "dispersive" in air)


*** Diet: Garlic (and thiol-heavy foods)
